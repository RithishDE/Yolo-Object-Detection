# YOLO11 Web App for Detection, Segmentation, and Pose Estimation

This project is a web application that leverages YOLO11 to perform real-time object detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. Built for efficiency and versatility, the app allows users to upload images or stream live video for analysis. The backend is powered by YOLO11, while the frontend is implemented using Flask and Streamlit for seamless interaction. The model can be fine-tuned for custom datasets, making it adaptable for various applications like personal protective equipment (PPE) detection, pothole segmentation, and human activity recognition. Additionally, advanced multi-object tracking is integrated using Bot-SORT and ByteTrack algorithms, enhancing tracking accuracy across frames. This project demonstrates the potential of YOLO11 in AI-driven computer vision applications and serves as a foundation for further research and real-world deployment.
